## Projects
### Wine quality analysis
The "Quality Wine Analysis" project aims to predict and assess the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. Beginning with the importation of essential libraries and the exploration of a wine quality dataset, the project progresses through data analysis, including statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover insights into the dataset's features and their correlations. Preprocessing steps address data cleaning, normalization, and categorical encoding to prepare the dataset for model training. Multiple machine learning models are then built and evaluated to predict wine quality, employing metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared for regression tasks. The project concludes with a comprehensive review of model performance and potential areas for further refinement, highlighting its application in providing actionable insights for the wine industry based on data-driven analysis.

### Hate speech detection task
Hate speech detection involves the automated identification of whether a piece of text contains content that is hateful or offensive. This task is crucial for maintaining safe and respectful online communities by filtering out harmful language. For this project, I developed a sophisticated classifier using PyTorch and a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is known for its effectiveness in natural language understanding.
The core of the project was to leverage the power of BERT to understand the context and nuances of language in detecting hate speech. BERT's pre-trained capabilities allow it to comprehend and process text efficiently, making it ideal for this classification task. Using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, provided the flexibility and efficiency needed to train and fine-tune the model to achieve high accuracy.

### Python Project for Data Engineering
The project emphasized Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, web scraping, and API usage. Data was extracted from various sources, including web scraping and APIs, transformed to meet specific criteria, and loaded into databases for analysis. This experience demonstrated proficiency in data manipulation, cleaning, and storage, allowing for handling real-world data engineering challenges. The project provided the ability to efficiently manage data workflows and apply Python programming effectively in data engineering contexts.
