## Projects

### Wine quality analysis
The "Quality Wine Analysis" project aims to predict and assess the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. Beginning with the importation of essential libraries and the exploration of a wine quality dataset, the project progresses through data analysis, including statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover insights into the dataset's features and their correlations. Preprocessing steps address data cleaning, normalization, and categorical encoding to prepare the dataset for model training. Multiple machine learning models are then built and evaluated to predict wine quality, employing metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared for regression tasks. The project concludes with a comprehensive review of model performance and potential areas for further refinement, highlighting its application in providing actionable insights for the wine industry based on data-driven analysis.

### Black Friday Purchases
The project aims to assist the organization's management team in analyzing customer purchasing behavior, with a particular emphasis on purchase amounts in relation to gender and other influencing factors. The objective is to determine whether spending patterns differ between male and female customers, particularly examining whether women spend more than men on Black Friday. The project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and uncover meaningful insights. Key steps include data cleaning, identifying unique and missing values, detecting duplicates, and generating statistical summaries. Data visualization is utilized for numerical and categorical features, and actionable insights are derived to better understand customer purchasing behavior and support strategic decision-making.

### Hate speech detection task
Hate speech detection involves the automated identification of whether a piece of text contains content that is hateful or offensive. This task is crucial for maintaining safe and respectful online communities by filtering out harmful language. For this project, I developed a sophisticated classifier using PyTorch and a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is known for its effectiveness in natural language understanding.
The core of the project was to leverage the power of BERT to understand the context and nuances of language in detecting hate speech. BERT's pre-trained capabilities allow it to comprehend and process text efficiently, making it ideal for this classification task. Using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, provided the flexibility and efficiency needed to train and fine-tune the model to achieve high accuracy.

The task is to create a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle by filling in the blank cells.

The solution must ensure that:

- Each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in every row.
- Each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in every column.
- Each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids.
